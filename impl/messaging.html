Events mostly correspond to things that happen in the<br>real world. The request message consists of a <a href="extras.html#bundle">bundle</a><br><a href="extras.html#tags">identified by the tag</a> &quot;<a href="http://hl7.org/fhir/tag/message&amp;quot" target="_blank" rel="external">http://hl7.org/fhir/tag/message&amp;quot</a>;,<br>with the first resource in the bundle being a <a href="messageheader.html">MessageHeader</a><br>resource. The MessageHeader resource has a code - the message event - that identifies the<br>nature of the request message, and it also carries additional request metadata.<br>The other resources in the bundle depend on the type of the request.<br><br>The events supported in FHIR, along with the resources that are included in them, are defined below.<br><br>The destination application processes the request and returns one or more response messages<br>which are also a <a href="extras.html#bundle">bundle</a> of resources<br><a href="extras.html#tags">identified by the tag</a> &quot;<a href="http://hl7.org/fhir/tag/message&amp;quot" target="_blank" rel="external">http://hl7.org/fhir/tag/message&amp;quot</a>;, with the first<br>resource in the bundle being a <a href="messageheader.html">MessageHeader</a> resource with a response<br>section that reports the outcome of processing the message and any additional response<br>resources required.<br><br>## <span class="sectioncount">2.3.1<a name="2.3.1"> </a></span> Basic Messaging Assumptions<br><br>This specification assumes that content will be delivered from one application<br>to another by some delivery mechanism, and then a response will be returned<br>to the source application. The exact mechanism of transfer is irrelevant to<br>this specification, but may include file transfer, http based transfer, MLLP<br>(HL7 minimal lower layer protocol), MQ series messaging or anything else.<br>The only requirement for the transfer layer is that requests are sent to<br>a known location and responses are returned to the source of the request.<br>This specification considers the source and destination applications as logical<br>entities, and the mapping from logical source and destination to implementation<br>specific addresses is outside the scope of this specification, though this<br>specification does provide a direct delivery mechanism below.<br><br>This specification assumes that content will be delivered from one application to<br>another by some delivery mechanism, and then one or more responses will be returned<br>to the source application. The agreements around the content of the messages and<br>the behavior of the two applications form the &quot;contract&quot; that describes the exchange.<br>The contract will add regional and local agreements to the rules defined in this<br>specification.<br><br>This specification ignores the existence of interface engines and message<br>transfer agents that exist between the <em>source</em> and <em>destination</em>.<br>Either they are transparent to the message/transaction content and irrelevant<br>to this specification, or they are actively involved in manipulating the message<br>content (in particular, the source and destination headers are often changed).<br>If these middleware agents are modifying the message content, then they become<br>responsible for honoring the contract that applies (including applicable profiles)<br>in both directions.<br><br>A key aspect of a message is the impact of it’s content:<br><br>  <!-- <table class="grid">
 <tr> <td>Consequence</td> <td>The message represents/requests a change that should not be processed more than once. E.g. Making a booking for an appointment</td> </tr>
 <tr> <td>Currency</td> <td>The message represents a response to query for current information. Retrospective processing is wrong and/or wasteful</td> </tr>
 <tr> <td>Notification</td> <td>The content is not necessarily intended to be current, and it can be reprocessed, though there may be version issues created by processing old notifications</td> </tr>

There must be at least<br>one response message so that the sender can know that the message was properly<br>received. Multiple response SHALL not be returned for messages of consequence,<br>and SHOULD not be returned for notifications.<br><br>In principle, source applications are not required to wait for a response to<br>a transaction before issuing a new transaction. However in many cases, the<br>messages in a given stream are dependent on each other, and must be sent and<br>processed in order. In addition, some transfer methods may require sequential<br>delivery of messages.<br><br>For this reason, a synchronous exchange pattern - where the sender sends a<br>message, and waits on the same channel for a single response, and then<br>sends the next message - are the easiest to understand and manage. The<br><a href="#mailbox">Mailbox</a> described below works in this fashion.<br><br>However synchronous message exchange does not cater for multiple response<br>messages, which may arise when processing queries, and also imposes<br>through-put limitations which may become relevant at high volumes.<br>Because of this, other complex message patterns are allowed, though<br>none are described in detail in this specification.<br><br>### <span class="sectioncount">2.3.1.2<a name="2.3.1.2"> </a></span> Message Identifiers<br><br>An incoming message contains two identifiers: the envelope id<br>(<a href="extras.html#bundles">feed</a>.id) and the <a href="messageheader.html">message</a>.identifier.<br>Each time a new message is created, it SHALL be assigned an identifier that is<br>unique within that message stream. Note that since message streams are often<br>merged with other streams, it is recommended that the identifier should be globally<br>unique. This can be achieved by using a UUID or an OID or appropriately<br>chosen URI with a serially incrementing number. Each time a message is sent,<br>the bundle identifier (feed.id) should be changed to a new value.<br><br>When a receiver receives and processes the message, it responds with a<br>new message with a new identifier, wrapped in a bundle which also has a new id.<br>The response message also quotes the request message identifier so that the source<br>system can relate the response to its request.<br><br><a name="reliable"> </a><br><br>### <span class="sectioncount">2.3.1.3<a name="2.3.1.3"> </a></span> Absence of Reliable Messaging<br><br>Some of the message delivery mechanisms mentioned above are reliable delivery<br>systems - the message is always delivered, or an appropriate error is returned<br>to the source. However most implementations use methods which do not provide<br>reliable messaging, and either the request or the response can get lost in transit.<br>FHIR messaging describes a simple approach that receivers SHOULD conform to in<br>order to handle the absence of reliable messaging that maintains predictable<br>functionality.<br><br>If the sender of the message implements reliable messaging, it SHALL do<br>the following when it receives no response to a message within a<br>configured timeout period:<br><br><table class="grid"><br> <tr><td>Consequence</td><td>Resend the same message (including with the same identifier) with the same envelope id</td></tr><br> <tr><td>Currency</td><td>Resend the same message (including with the same identifier) with a different envelope id</td></tr><br> <tr><td>Notification</td><td>Resend the same message (including with the same identifier) with a different envelope id</td></tr><br></table><br><br>When a receiver implements reliable messaging, it SHALL check the incoming envelope<br>id and message identifier against a cache of previously received messages. The<br>correct action to take depends on what is received:<br><br><table class="grid"><br> <tr><td>Both the envelope id and message identifier have not been received</td><td>This is the normal case, and the message should be processed</td></tr><br> <tr><td>Both envelope and message already received</td><td>The original response has been lost (failed to return to the request issuer), and the original response SHALL be resent</td></tr><br> <tr><td>The message identifier has already been received, but the envelope id is new</td><td>A previously seen message has been resubmitted for processing again. The server may either reprocess the message, or reject the message</td></tr><br> <tr><td>The envelope id has already been received, but the message identifier is new</td><td>This is an error - envelope ids should never be reused</td></tr><br></table><br><br>The duration period for caching does generally not need to be very long. At a minimum, it<br>could be 1 minute longer than the timeout of the sending system, though it may need to<br>be longer depending on the re-sending policies of the sending system.<br><br>Applications that implement reliable messaging declare their reliable cache<br>period in their <a href="conformance.html">conformance statement</a>.<br><br>#### <span class="sectioncount">2.3.1.3.1<a name="2.3.1.3.1"> </a></span> Example: Consequence<br><br>In the first example, a Clinical EHR issues an order for a particular imaging examination<br>to be performed on a patient. This is considered to be a message of <strong>Consequence</strong>: multiple<br>orders should not be created (in practice there are usually human review processes that<br>catch multiple orders, but repeat orders create entropy in the system that is harmful).<br>The EHR sends a message where the envelope id (feed.id) is UUID 1 (urn:uuid:72edc4e0-6708-42ab-9734-f56721882c10),<br>with a Message Header that contains a message id of UUID 2 (urn:uuid:dad53a57-dcb4-4f18-b066-7239eb4b5229).<br><br>The EHR system never receives a response to the message; it does not know whether the request<br>message got lost, or the imaging management systems was unable to process the request, or whether<br>it successfully processed the message and the response was lost. In this case, the EHR system<br>resends the message with same two identifiers.<br><br>In this case, the imaging system successfully received the message, and processed it. Because<br>it receives the resent order after 1 minute (which is within it’s 15 minute cache time),<br>and the two UUIDs 1 and 2 match a message it has already processed, it knows that it already<br>processed the order, and simply returns the previous response. In the case of additional resent<br>queries, the application keeps sending the original response, though it may also alert system<br>administrators that the same original message keeps being resent, since lost messages should be<br>a rare occurrence.<br><br>When the EHR system finally receives the message, it knows how the imaging management system<br>responded; it can be sure because the message id from the original request is echoed in the<br>response portion of the returned message.<br><br>#### <span class="sectioncount">2.3.1.3.2<a name="2.3.1.3.2"> </a></span> Example: Currency<br><br>In this second example, a Clinical EHR needs to know what appointment slots are available<br>for a particular imaging procedure. This is a message of <strong>Currency</strong>: available slots are<br>ever disappearing, and ordering a slot that has become unavailable is a waste of time for<br>the humans and systems involved. The EHR sends a message where the envelope id (feed.id) is<br>UUID 3 (urn:uuid:4c7f5cb2-5964-4d42-b719-e0227461818c), with a Message Header that contains<br>a message id of UUID 4 (urn:uuid:63ED7D68-B2CC-421D-BA1C-A6C7785581F2).<br><br>The EHR system never receives a response to the message; it does not know whether the request<br>message got lost, or the imaging management systems was unable to process the request, or whether<br>it successfully processed the message and the response was lost. In this case, the EHR system<br>resends the message with same message id (UUID 4), but creates a new envelope id (feed.id):<br>(urn:uuid:c7c17fe4-9560-49c7-b2ae-42636476fb86).<br><br>In this case, the imaging system successfully received the message, and processed it. When<br>it receives the resent order after 1 minute (which is within it’s 15 minute cache time), it<br>sees that although the message id is the same, the envelope id has changed, and it reprocesses<br>the message again, and sends a new response.<br><br>When the EHR system finally receives the message, it knows the current slot availability<br>on the imaging management system responded.<br><br>Note that the existence of active intermediaries (or &quot;middleware&quot;) creates the need<br>for this protocol - the original sender matches the response to the request based on the<br>message id, and so an active intermediary that choose the re-initiate a query that<br>it previously relayed cannot change the message id. This protocol avoids the need for<br>the message id to change, and only requires change to the envelope id which is never<br>the basis for context linking outside the immediate message exchange protocol described<br>here.<br><br>## <span class="sectioncount">2.3.2<a name="2.3.2"> </a></span> Conformance Statement<br><br>Applications may only assert conformance to &quot;FHIR messaging&quot; if they<br>publish a conformance statement so the claim may be verified. A<br>conformance statement lists all the message events supported (either<br>as sender or receiver) and for each event, a<br>profile that states which resources are bundled (sender), or<br>are required to be bundled (receiver), and any rules about the<br>information content of the individual resources. The conformance<br>statement is a <a href="conformance.html">resource with the name<br>&quot;Conformance&quot;</a>.<br><br><a name="mailbox"><br><br>## <span class="sectioncount">2.3.3<a name="2.3.3"> </a></span> Mailbox<br><br>The mailbox is the standard name for a service hosted on a <a href="http.html">RESTful server</a> that accepts<br>messages and processes<br>them as transactions and returns a message response appropriate for the message received. The server is under<br>no obligation to do anything particular with the resources except as required by the semantics of the event code in<br>the message resource. A server may choose to retain the resources and make them available on a RESTful interface, but<br>is not required to do so.<br><br>### <span class="sectioncount">2.3.3.1<a name="2.3.3.1"> </a></span> Submitting query messages and documents<br><br>The mailbox can also be used to accept queries or documents. In the case of documents, the document is &quot;accepted&quot;<br>(the server takes responsibility for custody of the received document)<br>or an HTTP error is returned. The server is under no obligation to perform any particular processing of the document<br>except as<br>specific trading partner agreements dictate. In the case of queries, the server receives a bundle containing<br>a query and a set of other related resources, processes the query, and returns a bundle with a query which is a response,<br>and any additional resources that are part of the query response.<br><br>### <span class="sectioncount">2.3.3.2<a name="2.3.3.2"> </a></span> Result of submission<br><br>Depending on the semantics of the event code or processing done on the query or document, a server may return<br>a status code 200 OK, 201 Created, 202 Accepted or 204 No Content. If the server returns 200 OK, it SHALL return a<br>bundle with the outcome of the event or document processing. In case of errors, the client SHALL interpret a<br>4xx response to indicate that there is no point resubmitting the message or document, and a 5xx response to indicate<br>an unexpected error on the part of the server, which means that it is worth resubmitting<br>(and doing so should not result in a duplicate message response).  Repeated failures indicate either a<br>fatal problem with the submission or a problem with the receiving application.<br><br>The following rules apply to the mailbox:<br><br><em>   The mailbox only accepts POST transactions - any other HTTP method will result in an HTTP error
</em>   The request content type submitted is always <a href="extras.html#bundle">a bundle</a> containing a message or document resource as the first resource<br><em>   The response content type returned is always an HTTP error, <a href="extras.html#bundle">a bundle</a> containing a message as the first resource, or empty (if a document was received)
</em>   If the response is an error, the body SHOULD be an <a href="operationoutcome.html">Errors &amp; Warning</a> resource with full details<br><em>   The URL never takes any parameters
</em>   The mailbox may be authenticated using standard HTTP authentication methods, including OAuth<br><br>This simple mailbox profile can be used by any HTTP end point that accepts FHIR messages or documents, not just<br>FHIR RESTful servers.<br><br>In order to ensure consistency of processing, the <a href="#reliable">logical rules regarding processing of envelope id and<br>message id described above</a> SHALL be followed when messages are processed using the mailbox.

The messaging and RESTful frameworks<br>are related in that both share the same set of resources on which they operate.<br>In fact, the basic <a href="messageheader.html">MessageHeader</a> resource<br>that the messaging framework is implemented is itself a resource that can treated in a RESTful approach.<br><br>The kinds of functionality that the RESTful API and the messaging framework<br>offer are very similar; their primary difference is architectural in nature.<br><br>For instance, the messaging framework defines an event for notifying that<br>a administration resource has been created or updated, as does the REST API.<br>On the other hand, there are differences in the capabilities offered - while<br>a patient merge can be implemented as a series of RESTful operations performed<br>by the client that update all resources linked to the patient, when a message<br>command to merge patient records is processed, the server will do all<br>the work, and is also able to merge in areas not exposed on the RESTful API.<br>The REST API, however, provides a set of basic operations on all resources<br>that would need special definitions in the messaging framework - definitions that<br>are not provided.<br><br>There is no expectation that RESTful systems will need to offer messaging<br>support, or vice versa, though systems may find it useful to support both<br>sets of functionality in order to satisfy a wider range of implementers.<br><br>As a resource that can be used with the RESTful framework, the MessageHeader<br>resource has the normal resource end-point (/MessageHeader), which is<br>used to manage a set of static message resources. This could be used to<br>make an archive of past messages available. <strong>Creating or updating MessageHeader resources<br>in this fashion does not represent the actual occurrence of any event, nor can it trigger<br>any logic associated with the actual event.</strong> It is just for managing a set of message resources.<br><br>In, addition, as described above, this specification defines the /Mailbox end-point<br>so that RESTful servers can offer both messaging and RESTful services at once.<br>Alternatively, messages can be transported between systems using any other method by which<br>a stream of bytes (the message bundle) can be moved from one place to<br>another.
