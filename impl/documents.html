The bundle gathers all the content<br>of the document into a single XML document which may be signed and managed as required. The<br>resources include both human readable and computer processable portions. In addition, the bundle<br>may include <a href="http://www.w3.org/Style/CSS/Overview.en.html" target="_blank" rel="external">CSS stylesheets</a><br><a href="provenance.html">provenance</a> statements, and a signature.<br><br>The composition resource is the foundation of the clinical document. It:<br><br><em>   provides identity and its purpose, sets the context of the document
</em>   carries key information such as the subject and author, and who attests to the document<br><em>   divides the document up into a series of sections that contain other resources identified in this specification that carry the content<br><br>Any resource referenced directly in the Composition SHALL be included in the bundle when the document<br>is assembled. Other resources that these referenced resources refer to may also be included in the<br>bundle if the document construction system chooses to so do. Including these additional resources will<br>make the document bigger, but will save applications from needing to retrieve the linked resources<br>if they need them while processing the document. Thus, whether these linked resources should be included or<br>not depends on the implementation environment.<br><br>The document bundle SHALL NOT include any resources not on this list:<br><br>1.  The Composition resource, and any resources directly or indirectly (i.e. recursively) referenced from it<br>2.  A Binary resource containing a stylesheet (as described below)<br>3.  Provenance Resources that have a target which is a resource included in item #1<br><br>There are two key identifiers on the document:

</em>   The document identifier (mandatory). This is found in <em>feed.id</em> and is unique for this instance of the document, and is never re-used<br><em>   The Composition identifier (optional). This is found in <em>Composition.identifier</em>, and is the same for all documents that are derived from this composition<br><br>The document has several dates in it:

</em>   The document date (mandatory). This is found in <em>feed.updated</em> and identifies when the document bundle was assembled from the underlying resources<br><em>   The Composition date (mandatory). This is found in <em>Composition.instant</em>, which is when the author wrote the document logically
</em>   The Attestation dates (optional). This is found in <em>Composition.attester.time</em> and is when the document was witnessed by the attesters. This would usually be at the same time as the composition date or afterwards<br><em>   The Composition last modified time (mandatory per Atom). This is found in <em>entry.updated</em> for the composition, and is the last date of change of the composition. This must be &gt;= the composition date<br><br>Document Bundles may be signed using digital signatures following the rules laid out in<br>the <a href="http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4287" target="_blank" rel="external">Atom specification</a>.<br>The signature SHOULD be provided by a listed attester of the document and the signature<br>SHOULD contain a <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/xmldsig-core/#sec-KeyInfo" target="_blank" rel="external">KeyInfo<br>element</a> that contains a KeyName element whose value is a URI that matches the Atom <em>link</em><br>element value for the matching attester resource.<br><br>Once assembled into a bundle, the document is immutable - its content can never be changed,<br>and the document id can never be reused. Note that the document may be represented in either<br>XML or JSON, and interconverted between these or have its character encoding changed, all<br>the while remaining the same document. However the content (the set of attested resources,<br>and their order) and the presentation of the document cannot change.

The Composition resource<br>2.  The Subject resource<br>3.  Resources referenced in the <em>section.content</em><br><br>The Composition resource narrative should summarize the important parts of the document header that are required<br>to establish clinical context for the document (other than the subject, which is displayed in its own<br>right). To actually build the combined narrative, simply append all the narrative &lt;div&gt; fragments<br>together.<br><br>The attested content of the document is the composition, the subject, and the resources<br>referenced in the sections. Additional resources can be included in the bundle, but<br>these are not attested content. Specifically, the attester attests to the presented<br>form of the document.<br><br>The <a href="downloads.html#refimpl">XML Tools reference implementation</a> includes a<br>transform that converts a document into browser-ready XHTML.<br><br><a name="css"><br><br>In addition to the <a href="narrative.html#css">basic style rules about Narratives</a>, which<br>must be followed, a document can reference or contain one or more stylesheets that contains additional styles that<br>apply to the collated narrative.

Stylesheet references can only refer to<br>a CSS stylesheet - other forms of stylesheet are not acceptable.<br><br>Relative (internal) references SHOULD be used if the document is not<br>safe to view without applying the specified stylesheet, as another location<br>might not be available to the viewer due to technical problems or policy decisions.<br><br>Unless otherwise agreed in local trading partner agreements, applications<br>displaying the collated narrative SHOULD use the stylesheets specified by the<br>document. Parties entering into a trading agreement to do otherwise should<br>consider the implications this action will have on their long term scope for document<br>exchange very carefully. If the parties agree to use stylesheets that are<br>not contained in the document, then it may be that they will never be able<br>to share their documents safely in a more general context, such as a regional<br>or national EHR or a global personal health record.<br><br>## <span class="sectioncount">2.4.2<a name="2.4.2"> </a></span> Document Profiles<br><br><a href="profile.html">Document profiles</a> are used to describe documents for a particular<br>purpose.

</em>   To assure that the content of document SHALL conform to any declared <a href="profile.html">Profiles</a> (see below).<br><em>   Ensure that the attesters are properly aware of the presentation of the document to which they are attesting<br><br>### <span class="sectioncount">2.4.3.2<a name="2.4.3.2"> </a></span> Processor Obligations<br><br>A document processor is an application and/or human user that receives documents, and extracts data from them,<br>or makes decisions because of them. The documents may be received directly from a document constructor, accessed<br>via a document management system or forwarded by a third party. The document processor is responsible for<br>ensuring that received documents are processed and/or rendered in accordance to this specification. A<br>document processor has the obligation to assure that the following rules are followed:

</em>   When storing/transmitting a document, any method may be used as long as the bundled document can be   (re-)assembled with sufficient integrity to validate a digital signature<br><em>   When presenting the narrative of the document, the rules described above SHALL be followed
</em>   Resources or data from the document may be extracted for additional uses, but such data is no longer considered to be attested by the document author<br><em>   Wherever the data from the document is displayed to a user, there SHOULD always be a way for the user to access a presentation of the original document<br><br>In addition to these obligations, document receivers SHOULD carefully track the source of<br>documents for new documents that supersede existing documents, particularly when the documents<br>represent compositions that have been retracted.
