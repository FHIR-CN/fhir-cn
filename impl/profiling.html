<p>The base FHIR specification (this specification) describes a set of base resources, frameworks<br>and APIs that are used in many different contexts in healthcare. However there is wide<br>between jurisdictions and across the healthcare eco-system around<br>practices, requirements, regulations, education and what actions are feasible<br>and/or beneficial.</p>
<p>For this reason, the FHIR specification is a &quot;platform specification&quot; - it creates<br>a common platform or foundation on which a variety of different solutions are implemented.<br>As a consequence, this specification requires further adaptation to particular<br>contexts of use. Typically, these adaptations specify:</p>
<ul>
<li>Rules about which resource elements are or are not used, and what additional elements are added that are not part of the base specification</li>
<li>Rules about which API features are used, and how</li>
<li>Rules about which terminologies and used in particular elements</li>
<li>Descriptions of how the Resource elements and API features map to local requirements</li>
</ul>
<p>Note that because of the nature of the healthcare eco-system, there may be multiple<br>overlapping set of adaptations - by healthcare domain, by country, by institution, and/or by vendor/implementation. </p>
<p>Typically, adaptations (either actual implementations or specifications - sometimes called &quot;Implementation Guides&quot;)<br>both restrict and extend APIs, resources and terminologies. FHIR provides a set of resources that<br>represent the decisions that have been made, and allows implementers to build useful services from them. These<br>resources are known as the conformance resources. These comformance resources allow implementers to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Indicate that <a href="http.html">some API calls</a> are not used for a particular use , and provide additional details about how the API calls are used (<a href="conformance.html">Conformance</a> Resource)</li>
<li>Add additional <a href="operations.html">operations</a> or <a href="search.html">search parameters</a> not in the base specification   (using the <a href="operationdefinition.html">OperationDefinition</a> resource or the <a href="searchparameter.html">SearchParameter</a> Resource</li>
<li>Identify specific elements in resources that are not used (<a href="profile.html">Profile</a> Resource)</li>
<li>Describe how existing elements in resources are used (Profile resource)</li>
<li>Define new elements that are used resources or data types (Profile resource)</li>
<li>Mix custom and standard terminologies and choose which codes from these to use for a particular use (Profile and <a href="valueset.html">Value Set</a> Resources)</li>
<li>Map between local and standard terminologies or content models (<a href="conceptmap.html">Concept Map</a> Resource)</li>
<li>Register system namespaces for identifiers and terminologies (<a href="namingsystem.html">NamingSystem</a> Resource)</li>
<li>Describe and register specific Data Elements that are used across systems in a Data Dictionary (<a href="dataelement.html">DataElement</a> Resource)</li>
</ul>
<p>These need to be used following the policies discussed below, and also<br>following the basic concepts for extension that are described in <a href="extensibility.html">&quot;Extensibility&quot;</a>.<br>For implementer convenience, the specification itself publishes its base definitions using these same resources.</p>
<p><a name="api"> </a></p>
<h3 id="2-11-0-1_Extending_and_Restricting_the_API"><span class="sectioncount">2.11.0.1<a name="2.11.0.1"> </a></span> Extending and Restricting the API</h3>
<p>A conformance resource lists the REST interactions (read, update, search, etc) that a server provides or that a client uses, along with<br>some supporting information for each. It can also be used to define a set of desired behavior (e.g. as part of a specification or<br>a Request for Proposal).  The only interaction that servers are required to support is the <a href="http.html#conformance">Conformance</a><br>interaction itself - to retrieve the server’s conformance statement. Beyond that, servers and clients support and use whichever<br>API calls are relevant to their use case.</p>
<p>In addition to the operations that FHIR provides, servers may provide additional<br>operations that are not part of the FHIR specification. Implementers can safely do this<br>by appending a custom operation name prefixed with ‘$’ to an existing FHIR URL, as the <a href="operations.html">Operations<br>framework</a> does. The Conformance resource supports defining what OperationDefinitions make use of particular<br>names on an end point.  If services are defined that are not declared using OperationDefinition, it may be<br>appropriate to use longer names, reducing the chance of collision (and confusion) with services declared by<br>other interfaces.  The base specification will never define operation names with a &quot;.&quot; in them, so<br>implementers are recommended to use some appropriate prefix for their names (such as &quot;ihe.someService&quot;)<br>to reduce the likelihood of name conflicts. </p>
<p>Implementations are encouraged, but not required, to define operations using the standard<br>FHIR operations framework - that is, to declare the operations using the OperationDefinition<br>resource, but some operations may involve formats that can’t be described that way. </p>
<p>Implementations are also able to extend the FHIR API using additional content types.<br>For instance, it might be useful to <a href="http.html#read">read</a> or <a href="http.html#update">update</a><br>the appointment resources using a vCard based format. vCard defines its own mime type, and these additional mime types can<br>safely be used in addition to those defined in this specification.</p>
<p><a name="resources"> </a></p>
<h3 id="2-11-0-2_Extending_and_Restricting_Resources"><span class="sectioncount">2.11.0.2<a name="2.11.0.2"> </a></span> Extending and Restricting Resources</h3>
<p>Extending and restricted resources is done with a &quot;Profile&quot; resource, which is a statement of rules about<br>how the elements in a resource are used, and where extensions are used in a resource. </p>
<h3 id="2-11-0-3_Limitations_of_Use"><span class="sectioncount">2.11.0.3<a name="2.11.0.3"> </a></span> Limitations of Use</h3>
<p>What profiles can do is limited in some respects:</p>
<ul>
<li>Profiles cannot break the rules established in the base specification (e.g. if the element cardinality is 1..1 in the base specification, a profile cannot say it is 0..1, or 1..*)</li>
<li>Profiles cannot specify default values or meanings for elements</li>
<li>Profiles cannot give more specific names to elements</li>
<li>It must be safe to process a resource without knowing of the profile</li>
</ul>
<p>The consequence of this is that if a profile mandates extended behavior that cannot<br>be ignored, it must also mandate the use of a <a href="extensibility.html#modifiers">modifier extension</a>.<br>Another way of saying this is that knowledge must be explicit in<br>the instance, not implicit in the profile. </p>
<p>As an example, if a profile wished to describe that a <a href="procedure.html">Procedure</a><br>resource was being negated (e.g. asserting that it never happened), it could not simply say<br>in the profile itself that this is what the resource means; instead, the profile must<br>say that the resource must have an extension that represents this knowledge. </p>
<p>There is the facility to mark resources that they can only be safely understood by<br>a process that is aware of and understands a set of published rules. For more information,<br>see <a href="resources.html#ruleset">Restricted Understanding of Resources</a>.</p>
<h3 id="2-11-0-4_Using_Profiles"><span class="sectioncount">2.11.0.4<a name="2.11.0.4"> </a></span> Using Profiles</h3>
<p>A profile specifies a set of restrictions on the content of a FHIR resource or data type.<br>Profiles are identified by their canonical URL, which should be the URL at which they<br>are published. The following kinds of statements can be made about how an element is used:</p>
<ul>
<li>Restricting the cardinality of the element. e.g. the base might allow 0..*, and a particular application might support 1..2</li>
<li>Ruling out use of an element by setting its maximum cardinality to 0</li>
<li>Restricting the contents of an element to a single fixed value</li>
<li>Making additional invariants on the content of nested elements within the resource (expressed as XPath statements)</li>
<li>Restricting the types for an element that allows multiple types</li>
<li>Requiring a typed element or the target of a resource reference to conform to another structure profile (declared in the same profile, or elsewhere)</li>
<li>Specifying a binding to a different terminology value set (see below)</li>
<li>Providing alternative definitions and examples for the elements defined in a Resource to explain how they are used in the context of the Profile</li>
<li>Providing more specific or additional mappings (e.g. to v2 or v3) for the resource when used in a particular context</li>
<li>Declaring that one or more elements in the profile must be ‘supported’ (see below)</li>
</ul>
<p>All of these changed definitions SHALL be restrictions that are consistent with the<br>rules defined in the base resource in the FHIR Specification. Note that some of<br>these restrictions can be enforced by tooling (and are by the FHIR tooling), but<br>others (e.g. alignment of changes to descriptive text) cannot be automatically enforced.</p>
<p>A profile contains a linear list of element declarations. The inherent<br>nested structure of the elements is derived from the <em>path</em> value of each element.<br>For instance, a sequence of the element paths like this:</p>
<ul>
<li>Root</li>
<li>Root.childA</li>
<li>Root.childA.grandchild1</li>
<li>Root.childB</li>
</ul>
<p>defines the following structure:</p>
<pre class="xml">
 &lt;Root&gt;
   &lt;childA&gt;
     &lt;grandChild/&gt;
   &lt;/childA&gt;
   &lt;childB/&gt;
 &lt;/Root&gt;
</pre>

<p>or its JSON equivalent. The structure is coherent - children are never<br>implied, and the path statements are always in order. The element list is<br>a linear list rather than being explicitly nested because element definitions<br>are frequently re-used in multiple places within a single profile, and this re-use<br>is easier with a flat structure.</p>
<p><a name="snapshot"> </a></p>
<h3 id="2-11-0-5_Differential_vs_Snapshot"><span class="sectioncount">2.11.0.5<a name="2.11.0.5"> </a></span> Differential vs Snapshot</h3>
<p>Profiles may contain either a differential statement, a snapshot<br>statement or both.</p>
<p>Differential statements describe only the differences that they make<br>relative to another profile (which is most often the base FHIR resource or data type).<br>For example, a profile may make a single element mandatory (cardinality 1..1).<br>In the case of a differential structure, it will contain a single element<br>with the path of the element being made mandatory, and a cardinality statement.<br>Nothing else is stated - all the rest of the structure is implied (note:<br>this implies that a differential profile can be sparse, and only<br>mention the elements that are changed, without having to list the<br>full structure).</p>
<p>In order to properly understand a differential structure, it must be<br>applied to the profile on which it is based. In order to save<br>tools from needing to support this operation (which is computationally intensive - and<br>impossible if the base structure is not available), a Profile<br>can also carry a &quot;snapshot&quot; - a fully calculated form of the<br>structure that is not dependent on any other structure. The FHIR<br>project provides tools for the common platforms that can populate<br>a snapshot from a differential.</p>
<p>Profiles can contain both a differential and a snapshot view.<br>In fact, this is the most useful form - the differential<br>form serves the authoring process, while the snapshot serves<br>the implementation tooling. Profile resources used in operational<br>systems should always have the snapshot view populated.</p>
<p><a name="slicing"> </a></p>
<h3 id="2-11-0-6_Slicing"><span class="sectioncount">2.11.0.6<a name="2.11.0.6"> </a></span> Slicing</h3>
<p>One common feature of profiles is to take an element that may occur more than once (e.g. in a list),   <!-- What about slicing type choices? --><br>and split the list into a series of sublists, each with different restrictions on the elements in the sublist with associated<br>additional meaning. In FHIR, this operation is known as &quot;Slicing&quot; a list. It is common to<br>“slice” a list into sub-lists containing just one element, effectively putting constraints on each element in the list.</p>
<p>Here is an example to illustrate the process:</p>
<p><img src="slicing.png" alt="Slicing diagram"></p>
<p>In this example, the base resource defines the &quot;related&quot; element which refers to<br>another Observation which is related to the main Observation and which may occur<br>multiple times. Each &quot;related&quot; element has a &quot;type&quot; element specifying the nature<br>of the relationship (component, replacement, derivation etc.), and a &quot;target&quot; element<br>which identifies the actual observation. In this diagram, for convenience, the contents<br>of the target element are shown in the inner box instead of the showing the target<br>reference explicitly. Also, to avoid adding clutter to this simplified example,<br>the &quot;name&quot; attribute of Observation is shown as just a code not a full CodeableConcept.</p>
<p>The profile for Blood Pressure constrains the related element list into<br>2 sublists of one element: a systolic element, and a diastolic element. Each of these<br>elements has a fixed value for the type element, and the profile also fixes the<br>contents of the target observation as well, specifying a fixed LOINC code for<br>the name and specifying that both have a value of type Quantity. This process<br>is known as &quot;slicing&quot; and the Systolic and Diastolic elements are called &quot;slices&quot;.</p>
<p>Note that when the resource is exchanged, the wire format that is exchanged is not<br>altered by the profile. This means that the item profile names defined in the<br>profile (&quot;systolic&quot;, etc. in this example) are never exchanged. A resource<br>instance looks like this:</p>
<pre>
 &lt;Observation&gt;
   ...
   &lt;related&gt;
     &lt;type value=&quot;component&quot;/&gt;
     &lt;target ...&gt; &lt;!-- has the name &quot;8480-6&quot; --&gt;
   &lt;/related&gt;
   &lt;related&gt;
     &lt;type value=&quot;component&quot;/&gt;
     &lt;target ...&gt;  &lt;!-- has the name &quot;8462-4&quot; --&gt;
   &lt;/related&gt;
 &lt;/Observation&gt;
</pre>

<p>In order to determine that the first related item corresponds to &quot;Systolic&quot; in<br>the profile  to determine to which additional constraints for a sub-list the item conforms,<br>the system checks the values of the elements - in this case, the name element<br>in the resource that target refers to. This element is called the “discriminator”.</p>
<p><a name="discriminator"> </a></p>
<h3 id="2-11-0-7_Discriminator"><span class="sectioncount">2.11.0.7<a name="2.11.0.7"> </a></span> Discriminator</h3>
<p>In the general case, systems processing resources using a profile<br>that slices a list can determine which profile slice an item in<br>the list by checking whether its content meets the rules specified<br>for the slice. </p>
<p>This requires for a processor to be able to check all the rules<br>applied in the slice and to do so speculatively in a depth-first<br>fashion. Neither of these is appropriate for an operational system,<br>and particularly not for generated code. For this reason, a slice<br>can nominate a set of fields that act as a &quot;discriminator&quot; - they<br>are used to tell the slices apart. </p>
<p>When a discriminator is provided, the composite of the values of<br>the elements nominated in the discriminator is unique and distinct<br>for each possible slice and applications can easily determine<br>which slice an item in a list corresponds to. The intention is that<br>this can be done in generated code.</p>
<p>When a profile nominates one or more discriminators, it SHALL<br>fix the value of the element for each discriminator for each<br>slice, or if the element has a terminology binding, it SHALL be<br>associated with a complete binding with a version specific <a href="valueset.html">Value Set</a><br>reference that enumerates the possible codes in the value set.<br>The profile SHALL ensure that there is no overlap between the<br>set of values and/or codes in the value sets between slices.</p>
<p>It is the composite (combined) values of the discriminators<br>that are unique, not each discriminator alone. For example,<br>a slice on a list of items that are references to other<br>resources could nominate fields from different resources,<br>where each resource only has one of the nominated elements,<br>as long as they are distinct across slices. </p>
<p>A profile is not required to nominate any discriminator at all<br>for a slice, but profiles that don’t identify discriminators are describing<br>content that is very difficult to process, and so this is<br>discouraged.</p>
<p>Within a profile, a slice is defined using multiple <em>element</em><br>entries that share a <em>path</em> but have distinct _name_s.<br>These entries together form a &quot;slice group&quot; that is:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Initiated by a &quot;slicing entry&quot;</strong> That is, the first<pre><code><span class="title">_element</span>_ <span class="operator">in</span> <span class="operator">a</span> slice group must contain <span class="operator">a</span>
<span class="title">_slicing</span>_ property that defines <span class="operator">the</span>
<span class="title">_discriminator</span>_ <span class="keyword">for</span> all members <span class="operator">of</span> <span class="operator">the</span> group.  It also <span class="operator">contains</span> <span class="operator">the</span> unconstrained definition <span class="operator">of</span> <span class="operator">the</span> <span class="keyword">element</span> that is sliced
</code></pre></li>
<li><strong>Mutually exclusive</strong>. This means that each<pre><code>_element_ <span class="keyword">in</span> a slice group <span class="type">SHALL</span> describe a
<span class="keyword">distinct</span> <span class="type">set</span> <span class="keyword">of</span>  values <span class="keyword">for</span> the group's
_discriminators_.  <span class="type">Because</span> <span class="keyword">of</span> this constraint, an            element <span class="keyword">in</span> a resource **instance** will never match more
than one _element_ <span class="keyword">in</span> a given slice group. <span class="type">If</span> no discriminators are named,    it <span class="type">SHOULD</span> still be possible to differentiate the slices based    on their properties, though it may be substantially harder to    <span class="keyword">do</span> so
</code></pre></li>
<li><strong>Serialized as a group</strong>. The entries in a slice<pre><code><span class="keyword">group</span> must be **adjacent** <span class="keyword">in</span> a serialized Profile,
**<span class="keyword">or</span>**, <span class="keyword">if</span> there are any intervening elements, those
elements must be &amp;quot;compatible <span class="keyword">with</span>&amp;quot; the <span class="keyword">group</span>. Concretely, this
means that any intervening elements must have a
_path_ that starts <span class="keyword">with</span> the slice groups<span class="comment">'s</span>
_path_.  <span class="keyword">For</span> example, an _element_ <span class="keyword">with</span> a
_path_ <span class="keyword">of</span> _Observation.name.extension_
would be compatible <span class="keyword">with</span> (<span class="keyword">and</span> thus, would <span class="keyword">not</span> &amp;quot;break up&amp;quot;) a
slice <span class="keyword">group</span> whose path was _Observation.name_
</code></pre></li>
</ol>
<p>The value of the discriminator element is a path name that identifies<br>the descendant element using a dotted notation. For references, the path<br>transitions smoothly across the reference and into the children of the<br>root element/object of the resource. For extensions, an extension can be<br>qualified with the URL of the extensions being referred to.<br>There are two special names: @type, and @profile. Here are some example discriminators:</p>
<table class="grid"><br> <tr>  <td><strong>Context</strong></td> <td><strong>Discriminator</strong></td> <td><strong>Interpretation</strong></td> </tr><br> <tr>  <td>List.entry</td> <td>item.reference.name</td> <td>Entries are differentiated by the name element on the target resource - probably an observation, which could be determined by other information in the profile</td> </tr><br> <tr>  <td>List.entry</td> <td>item.reference.@type</td> <td>Entries are differentiated by the type of the target element that the reference points to</td> </tr><br> <tr>  <td>List.entry</td> <td>item.reference.@profile</td> <td>Entries are differentiated by a profile tag on the target of the reference, as specified by a profile (todo: how to do that?)</td> </tr><br> <tr>  <td>List.entry</td> <td>item.extension[&quot;<a href="http://acme.org/extensions/test&quot;].code" target="_blank" rel="external">http://acme.org/extensions/test&quot;].code</a></td> <td>Entries are differentiated by the value of the code element in the extension with the nominated URL</td> </tr><br> <tr>  <td>List.entry.extension</td> <td>url</td> <td>Extensions are differentiated by the value of their url property (usually how extensions are sliced)</td> </tr><br> <tr>  <td>List.entry</td> <td>item.reference.@type, item.reference.name</td> <td>Extensions are differentiated by the combination of item.reference.name, and, if it has one, the name element. This would be<br>   appropriate for where a List might be comprised of a Condition, and set of observations, each differentiated by it’s name - the condition has no name, so that is evaluated as a null in the discriminator set</td> </tr><br></table>

<h3 id="2-11-0-8_Extension_Definitions"><span class="sectioncount">2.11.0.8<a name="2.11.0.8"> </a></span> Extension Definitions</h3>
<p>An extension definition defines the url that identifies the extension<br>and which is used to refers to the extension definition when it is used<br>in a resource.</p>
<p>The extension definition also defines the context where the extension can be used (usually<br>a particular path or a data type) and then defines the extension element using the same details used to<br>profile the structural elements that are part of resources. This means that a single extension<br>can be defined once and used on different Resource and/or datatypes, e.g. one would only have to<br>define an extension for “hair color” once, and then specify it can be used on both Patient and Practitioner.</p>

<p>Once defined, an extension can be used in an instance of a resource<br>without any Profile declaring that it can, should or must be, but<br>Profiles can be used to describe how an extension is used.</p>
<p>To actually prescribe the use of an extension in an instance, the extension list<br>on the resource needs to be sliced. This is shown in <a href="extensibility-examples.html#sliceextensions">the extensibility<br>examples</a></p>
<p>Note that the minimum cardinality of an extension SHALL be a valid restriction<br>on the minimum cardinality in the definition of the extension. if the minimum<br>cardinality of the extension is 1 when it is defined, it can only be mandatory<br>when it is added to a profile. This is not recommended - the minimum cardinality<br>of an extension should usually be 0. </p>

<h3 id="2-11-0-9_Binding_Definitions"><span class="sectioncount">2.11.0.9<a name="2.11.0.9"> </a></span> Binding Definitions</h3>
<p>Coded elements have bindings that link from the element to a definition of the<br>set of possible codes the element may contain. The binding identifies the<br>definition of the set of possible codes and controls how tightly the set of the possible codes is interpreted.</p>
<p>The set of possible codes is either a formal reference to a <a href="valueset.html">ValueSet</a><br>resource, which may be version specific, or a general reference to some web content that defines a set of<br>codes. The second is most appropriate where set of values is defined by<br>some external standard (such as mime types). Alternatively, where the binding<br>is incomplete (e.g. under development) just a text description of the<br>possible codes can be provided. </p>
<p>Bindings have two properties that define how the set of codes is used: <em>isExtensible</em> and <em>conformance</em>.</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>isExtensible</strong><a name="extensibility"> </a>indicates whether additional codes are allowed beyond those in the defined set of codes.</p>
<pre><code>&lt;<span class="built_in">table</span>&gt;
</code></pre><p>  <tr><td>false</td> <td>No additional codes are to be used beyond the list provided</td> </tr><br>  <tr><td>true</td>  <td>Supplemental codes or plain text may be needed (this is common because it is frequently the case that concepts will need to be used which won’t be in the defined set of codes)</td></tr><br></p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Conformance</strong><a name="conformance"> </a>indicates the expectations for implementers of the specification.    There are three possible values:</p>
<table><br>  <tr><td>required</td><td><br>    <p>Only codes in the specified set are allowed.<br><br>    If the strength is ‘extensible’, other codes may be used for concepts not covered by the        value set but cannot be used for concepts covered by the bound code list, even        if a profile constrains out some of those codes).<br><br>      </p></td></tr><br>  <tr><td>preferred</td><td><br>    For greater interoperability, implementers are strongly encouraged to use the bound set of<br>    codes, however alternate codes may be used in profiles if necessary without being considered<br>    non-conformant.<br>  </td></tr><br>  <tr><td>example</td><td><br>    The codes in the set are an example to illustrate the meaning of the field.<br>    There is no particular preference for the set’s use.<br>  </td></tr><br></table>

</li>
</ul>
<p>The interplay between the meaning of these is subtle but sometimes important. The following table helps<br>define the meanings:</p>
<table><br> <tr><td><strong>Conformance</strong></td><td><strong>isExtensible=false</strong></td><td><strong>isExtensible=true</strong></td></tr><br> <tr><td><strong>Required</strong></td><td>Implementers SHALL use a code from the defined set</td><td>Implementers SHALL use a code from the defined set if one is applicable, but otherwise may provide their own code or use text</td></tr><br> <tr><td><strong>Preferred</strong></td><td>Implementers SHOULD use a code from the defined set<br>Using a different code will generate a warning from a validator</td><td>Implementers SHOULD use a code from the defined set if one is applicable, but MAY provide their own code or use text</td></tr><br> <tr><td><strong>Example</strong></td><td>Implementers MAY use a code from the defined set, or provide their own code, or use text</td></tr><br></table>

<p>Note: Example binding isExtensible = false is not generally a useful statement. </p>

<p><a href="valueset.html">Value Set</a> resources can be used to define local codes (Example) and<br>to mix a combination of local codes and standard codes (examples: LOINC, SNOMED), or just<br>to choose a particular set of standard codes (examples: LOINC, SNOMED, RxNorm).<br>Profiles can bind to these value sets instead of the ones defined in the base<br>specification, following these rules:</p>
<table class="grid"><br> <tr> <td><strong>Binding Type in base specification</strong></td> <td><strong>Matching Profile Properties</strong></td> <td><strong>Customization Rules in Profiles</strong></td> </tr><br><br> <tr> <td>Complete</td> <td>conformance = required, extensible = false</td> <td>The value set can only contain codes contained in the value set specified by the FHIR specification</td> </tr><br> <tr> <td>Incomplete</td> <td>conformance = preferred and extensible = true</td> <td>The value set can contain codes not found in the base value set. These additional codes SHOULD not have the same meaning as existing codes in the base value set</td> </tr><br> <tr> <td>Example</td> <td>conformance = example</td> <td>The value set can contain whatever is appropriate for local use</td> </tr><br></table>

<h3 id="2-11-0-11_Must_Support"><span class="sectioncount">2.11.0.11<a name="2.11.0.11"> </a></span> Must Support</h3>
<p>One property that can be declared on profiles that is not declared on the resource or data type definitions is &quot;Must Support&quot;.<br>This is a boolean property.  If true, it means that systems claiming to conform to a given profile must &quot;support&quot; the element.<br>This is distinct from cardinality.  It is possible to have an element with a minimum cardinality of &quot;0&quot;, but still expect systems<br>to support the element.</p>
<p>The meaning of &quot;support&quot; is left deliberately ambiguous.  Examples might include:</p>
<ul>
<li>The system must be able to store and retrieve the element</li>
<li>The system must display the element to the user and/or allow the user to capture the element via the UI</li>
<li>The element must appear in an output report</li>
<li>The element must be taken into account when performing decision support, calculations or other processing</li>
<li>etc.</li>
</ul>
<p>The specific meaning of &quot;Must Support&quot; for the purposes of a particular profile SHALL be described in the Profile.description or in other documentation for the<br>implementation guide the profile is part of.</p>
<p>If creating a profile based on another profile, Must Support can be changed from false to true, but cannot be changed from true to false.</p>

<h3 id="2-11-0-12_Search_Criteria"><span class="sectioncount">2.11.0.12<a name="2.11.0.12"> </a></span> Search Criteria</h3>
<p>The final thing implementations can do is to define search criteria in addition to those defined in the specification itself.<br>Search criteria fall into one of four categories:</p>
<ol>
<li>Enabling search on core elements that don’t have standard search criteria defined (e.g. searching Observation by normal range)</li>
<li>Enabling search on elements that already have a standard search criteria defined, but with custom matching rules.  E.g. a sounds-like search on Practitioner name</li>
<li>Enabling search on a particular extension</li>
<li>Enabling search that doesn’t correspond to a single element but rather a combination of elements or computation on an element.  E.g. searching for patients by age</li>
</ol>
<p>Additional Search Parameters can be defined using the <a href="searchparameter.html">SearchParameter</a> resource.</p>
