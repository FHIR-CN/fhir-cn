However FHIR does define exchange protocols and content models that need to be used<br>with various security protocols defined elsewhere. This section gathers all information about security<br>in one section. A summary:<br><br><em>   Communications Security - all exchange of production data should be secured using TLS/SSL (e.g. https)
</em>   Authentication - Users/Clients may be authenticated in any way desired. For web-centric use, OAuth is recommended<br><em>   Authorization/Access Control - FHIR defines a Security Label infrastructure to support access control management. FHIR may also define a set of resources to administer access control management, but does not define any at present
</em>   Audit - FHIR defines <a href="provenance.html">provenance</a> and <a href="securityevent.html">security event</a> resources suitable for tracking the origins, authorship, history, status and access of resources<br><em>   Digital Signatures - FHIR includes several specifically reserved locations for digital signatures
</em>   Attachments - FHIR allows for binary resources and attachments. These have their own concerns<br><em>   <a href="security-labels.html">Labels</a> - FHIR allows for set of security related tags that affect that way resources are handled
</em>   Data Management Policies - FHIR defines a set of capabilities to support data exchange.<br>     Not all the capabilities that FHIR enables may be appropriate or legal for use in some combinations of context and jurisdiction (e.g. HIPAA for exchange between institutions).     It is the responsibility of implementers to ensure that relevant regulations and other requirements are met<br><em>   Narrative - Care must be taken when displaying the narrative from FHIR resources<br><br>Time critical concerns regarding security flaws in the FHIR specification should be addressed to<br>the <a href="http://wiki.hl7.org/index.php?title=FHIR_email_list_subscription_instructions" title="FHIR_email_list_subscription_instructions" target="_blank" rel="external">FHIR email<br>list</a> for prompt consideration. Alternatively, issues can be raised through the<br><a href="http://wiki.hl7.org/index.php?title=FHIR_Security_Page" title="FHIR_Security_Page" target="_blank" rel="external">community input</a> mechanism.<br><br>Implementers should track the developing IHE IUA Profile for additional security considerations.<br><br>A production FHIR system will need some kind of security sub-system that administers<br>users, user authentication and user-authorization. Where this sub-system fits into the<br>deployment architecture is a matter for system design:<br><br><table class="dense"><br> <tr><br>  <td valign="center"><br> <img src="security-layout.png" alt=""><br></td><br><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><br><td style="border-left: 1px solid grey" valign="center"><br><table class="dense"><br> <tr><td><img src="security-icon-user.png" alt=""></td><td>The consumer that is using a healthcare related system</td></tr><br> <tr><td><img src="security-icon-app.png" alt=""></td><td>The client application the user is using (application, mobile app, website, etc.)</td></tr><br> <tr><td><img src="security-icon-sec.png" alt=""></td><td>The security system (authentication and access control)</td></tr><br> <tr><td><img src="security-icon-fhir.png" alt=""></td><td>The clinical/healthcare repository</td></tr><br></table><br></td></tr></table><br><br>In this diagram, the red lines represent FHIR interfaces. From the perspective of the FHIR API,<br>the client (consumer of FHIR services) may either interact with a security system that manifests<br>as a FHIR server, and which depends on a subsequent FHIR interface to provide the actual storage,<br>or either the client or server interacts with the security system independently. In each of these<br>3 scenarios, the different components may be assembled into applications or network components<br>differently, but the same logical layout applies. The FHIR specification assumes that a security<br>system exists, and that it may be deployed in front of or behind the FHIR API.<br><br><a name="access-control"> </a><br><br>The security system includes the following subsystems:

</em>   Authentication: Identifies and Authenticates the user<br><em>   Access Control decision engine: decides whether FHIR operations are allowed
</em>   Audit Log: records actions to allow for subsequent review and detection of intrusion or inappropriate usage<br><br>Because there are a plethora of standards relating to<br>the administration and functionality of the security system, FHIR does not provide user,<br>profile, or other such administration resources. Instead, the FHIR resources are the targets<br>of the policies expressed in these other approaches. What FHIR does specify is a way to apply<br><a href="security-labels.html">security labels</a> to resources so that a security system may use these (along with the contents<br>of the resources if appropriate) to determine whether a user is authorized to perform a<br>particular FHIR operation or not.<br><br>  <!-- These HTTP calls may be authenticated against a single user account (including 
using [OAuth](http://www.oauth.org)), but this arrangement doesn't cater for common transaction metadata such as multiple users, 
responsible party, reasons, consents, etc. that are commonly encountered in healthcare. Instead, 
use of this RESTful implementation assumes that appropriate security and logs are managed by the client (perhaps 
through using [ATNA](http://wiki.ihe.net/index.php?title=Audit_Trail_and_Node_Authentication "Audit_Trail_and_Node_Authentication")), and 
that the server trusts the client to maintain these. One implication is that this RESTful framework is 
only suitable for use where such trust relationships exist (e.g. in a single institution) and is not 
suitable where such trust does not exist (e.g. state &amp; national EHR systems and health record 
systems that support disparate systems). Similarly, this simple RESTful interface has no support for 
explicit archiving and similar functions. Use-cases where these kind of features are required should 
consider a [messaging](messaging.html) or [SOA-based approach](implementation.html#SOA) or 
some other kind of profiled REST interface. --><br><br><a name="http"> </a><br><br>## <span class="sectioncount">2.13.0.1<a name="2.13.0.1"> </a></span><br>Communications<br><br>For the <a href="http.html">RESTful API</a>, normal HTTP security rules apply.<br>The <a href="http.html#root">Service Root URL</a> will specify whether SSL is required.<br>Client authentication may be required by the server, possibly including the requirement for<br>client certificates.<br><br>SSL SHOULD be used for all production data exchange.<br><br>To support browser-based client applications, recommend that servers SHOULD implement <a href="http://enable-cors.org/" target="_blank" rel="external">cross-origin resource sharing</a> for the <a href="http.html">REST operations</a>.<br><br><a name="authentication"> </a><br><br>## <span class="sectioncount">2.13.0.2<a name="2.13.0.2"> </a></span> Authentication<br><br>Other than testing systems, FHIR servers should authenticate the clients.<br>The server may choose to authenticate the client system and trust it, or to authenticate<br>the individual user by a variety of techniques.

But real world usage will generally require this.<br><br>A holder of data should not allow the data to be communicated unless there is assurances that the<br>other party is authorized to receive it.

For<br>this reason, the <a href="narrative.html#security">FHIR narrative is not allowed to contain active content</a>.<br>However, care is still needed when displaying the narrative:<br><br><em>   Validate the narrative (the standard FHIR schemas do not allow active content, and the reference implementations won’t handle it). Note, though, that external references could still be included in CSS, and these are outside the scope of schemas and reference implementations.
</em>   Ensure that any external references to images or anchors (e.g. outside the resource) do not cause the display software to <a href="http://smartplatforms.org/2014/04/security-vulnerabilities-in-ccda-display/" target="_blank" rel="external">leak sensitive information in headers</a><br>*   Do not allow external links to run in a privileged context such as the EHR unless you are sure they can be trusted<br><br>Also note that the inclusion of an external reference to an image can allow the server that hosts the image to track<br>when the resource is displayed. This may be a feature or a problem depending on the context.<br><br></div>
